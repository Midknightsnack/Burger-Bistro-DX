# Burger-Bistro-DX

This is a remastered version of a project I did back in college. Initially it was in C++ and CSS, but that was hard to do. Now it's in HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

Ideally you'd start off at the homepage. This is where you'll see Burger Bistro's mascot, Burgie. I you hover your mouse over him, he'll close his eyes. There's also images of the menu at the bottom scrolling through.

By clicking the menu button on the navigation bar, you'll visit the menu. Each menu item is divided into 4 categories: burgers, deluxe burgers, sides, and drinks.

In this section, you can write a review. Click the number of stars you want to give the restaurant, input your name, write a review, and submit once you're done. All items in the review form must be filled out. Other customer reviews can be shown at the bottom.

In the locations section, you can find Burger Bistro locations near you but they don't exist.

Burger Bistro menu items can be ordered online. You can add the items you want to your cart, increase or decrease the quantity, and remove them if you change your mind. Once you've filled your shopping cart, review your order and click purchase.
